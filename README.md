# Dexcom-ESP32-Reader

This project is very experimental and not intended for use in therapy!

ESP32 that can read Dexcom G5/G6 (glucose, raw, calibration, battery, ...) data.

Developed in the context of my bachelor thesis at the Technical University (TU) of Darmstadt under the supervision of the Telecooperation Lab and Jens Heuschkel.
